## Architecture

The "My-client" project follows a modular and component-based architecture, leveraging the features provided by Vue 3 and Tailwind CSS. The architecture consists of the following layers:

1. **Components**: These are the reusable building blocks of the application. They are responsible for rendering the UI and handling user interactions. In the Task Management System, components may include task lists, task cards, user avatars, and form inputs.

2. **Pages**: These are the application's main views, composed of components. Pages correspond to the different routes in the app, such as the dashboard, task details, and user management. In the Task Management System, pages may include a task dashboard, task details, and user management.

3. **Services**: This layer is responsible for handling all API calls and data fetching. It abstracts the communication with the "my-server" backend. In the Task Management System, services may include functions to fetch tasks, create tasks, update tasks, and manage users.

4. **State Management**: This layer is responsible for managing the application's global state using Vuex. It stores and manages data that needs to be shared across components. In the Task Management System, the global state may include the list of tasks, task details, and user information.

5. **Utilities**: This layer contains utility functions and helper classes that are used throughout the application. These utilities can include custom hooks, data formatting, and validation functions.
